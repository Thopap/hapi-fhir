type: fix
issue: 3486
title: "When doing package upload, filtering on the value of active for all resources is not a great solution, as that 
field means different things to different resources. For Subscription, we need to check if the value is requested, for 
DocumentReference and Communication. This change adds a check for those types of resources outside of the normal 
check done for active matching value."
